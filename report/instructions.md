1. Write a short report (4 pages, NeurIPS style) detailing:  
    * the question being answered
    * explain your data collection
    * make a visualization and/or do some statistical analysis (you can use methodology not covered in the lecture, if you can properly support/cite/explain it.)
    * make decent plots (lecture 12)
    * discuss limitations/confidences/problems
    * support your argument with citations
2. Provide a git repo holding your analysis (lecture 11)
3. Submit your report & repo by 7 February  

The project will be graded. The grade of the project makes up 20% of the overall grade (the other 80%
arise from the exam).  
Projects can contain both visualization and analysis. If you decide to only do one, make sure you
do it well. Some graphical content (plots) is needed in either case.  
The main goal of this part of the course is for you to collect experience working with raw data.
That is, in particular  
 - accessing data procedurally (i.e. using code, not a spreadsheet)
 - structuring a data-centric project in code / repo
 - dealing with messy real-world data
 - identifying things to talk about, and supporting them meaningfully with data, citations, analyses
 - presenting your analysis well, graphically (make 1â€“3 nice plots)
 - writing a (short) academic text, in decent English, with proper layout, and clean citations.
